# data-analysis-with-python

This repository is a space for useful and essential Python codes for data analysis. It start from fundamental Python knowledge, such as data type and for loop, to popular analytics packages, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Key topics such as data wrangling, data visulization, and statistical concepts are explored throughout the notebooks. 

The goal of thie repository is for me to continuously expand the coding assets, familiarize with the functionalities, and generate efficient data analysis scripts.
